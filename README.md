# Graph-Neural-Networks-Exploring-GNN-Types-Tasks-and-Top-Models
As in text(1D), images(2D), and videos(3D), there is a portion of issues that exist in graphs or networks, such as social networks, protein-interaction networks, in this blog we will learn how to solve that issues with graph neural networks(GNNs).
