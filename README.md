# üåê Mastering Graph Neural Networks: GNN Types, Tasks, and Top Models üöÄ

Welcome to the **Mastering Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** repository! This project is dedicated to exploring the fascinating world of GNNs, covering everything from foundational concepts to advanced models and applications.

## üìö Overview

Graphs are an essential data structure used to represent relationships between entities, such as social connections, protein interactions, and more. Traditional neural networks often struggle with these complex structures, but Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer powerful solutions.

In this repository, you'll find comprehensive insights into GNNs, including:

- **Introduction to GNNs**: Understand the basics of graph data structures and how GNNs leverage them.
- **GNN Types and Tasks**: Learn about various GNN architectures and the tasks they excel at.
- **Prominent GNN Models**: Dive deep into popular models like GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE.

## üî• Key Features

- **Graph Data Structure**: Get to know how nodes and edges form the backbone of graph data.
- **GNN Intuition**: Discover how GNNs process and represent graph information through embeddings and computational graphs.
- **Types of Learning Tasks**: Explore node-level, edge-level, and graph-level tasks that GNNs can perform.
- **Top GNN Models**: Understand the intricacies of GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE, and see how they differ in handling graph data.
